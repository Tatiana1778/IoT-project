# IoT-project - The RestRoom Status Light 
The main purpose of the project is to show people when the toilets are vacant and occupant. If it is available, one can see it on the display which says 'Vacant' with green background or as a green LED light and hear it, when the buzzer rings. In case it is not available, display has clear 'Occupied' statemnt with red background and red LED light. There is no sound of buzzer.
